## 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Usage Enforcement**: Prevent actions that would exceed plan limits

## 7. Billing Integration (Mock)
- **Payment Simulation**: Mock Stripe integration for billing workflows
- **Billing Calculations**: Calculate costs based on plans and billing cycles
- **Payment Processing**: Simulate payment success/failure scenarios
- **Billing History**: Maintain audit trail of billing transactions

  - Subscription oversight and manual adjustments
- **Tenant Admin Dashboard**: Organization-specific view of:
  - Current subscription and usage status
  - Team member management
  - Plan upgrade/downgrade options
  - Billing information and history

## 9. Data Security & Compliance
